## Scx

Scx is file extension for scenario files in Age of Empires.

## Typescript

Typescript is superior language for javascript, which at the end it's compiled to javascript.
In AgeScx-js it is mostly used because of it's support for data types (they are really helpful,
if you are reading binary files) and also provides interfaces, so you can easily use data types in
your own project.
