## Scx

Scx is file extension of scenario files in Age of Empires. It meas *scenario extension*.

## Typescript

Typescript is superior language for javascript, which at the end it's compiled to javascript.
In AgeScx-js it is mostly used because of data types (they are really helpful, if you are
reading binary files) and also provides interfaces, so you can easily use data types in
your project.
